# Tritium Irradiator

Tritium as an energy source is not viable yet but the radiation from a tritium fusion reaction can be used as a radiation beam.

## Application notes
- Utilize the beam of radiation in weapon systems
- Sustained 14Mev neutrons can be detonators for nuclear warheads.Tritium urchins

- A Tritium detonator with fissile material with tritium.
- fusion, fission, fusion
- Loitering drones with radiation payload

## Tritium Nuclear Fizzler
- fast neutrons from a fusor can predetonate or accelerate nuclear decay of nuclear warheads.
- Remote detonation of warheads utilizing fast neutron.
