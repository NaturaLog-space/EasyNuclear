Nuclear Easy and Cheap 
Every research is being leaked so I decided that this project should be open source.

Why the Ukraine war is good for the Russian Lithium Source.


## Simple Source of Tritium
- Lithium recycling as a source of lithium
- Lithium bombardment with neutrons
- Lithium turns into Tritium seen in the Castle Bravo bombs.

## Retrofitting Nuclear Reactors
- Pump Lithium/Cobalt into the reactor
- Lithium turns into helium and tritium
- Cobalt turns into cobalt 60

## Cost of Tritium
- $30000 estimated price per gram
- $1/kg Cost of Lithium Scrap
- Cheap and easy with a neutron source such as nuclear reactors

## Replenishing the Expiring Tritium in the Nuclear Warheads
- Nuclear warheads with Tritium needs to be replaced after few half lives of Tritium.

## Further usages of excess Tritium
- Lightweight clean Tritium warheads on lightweight drones
