# Easy Clean Nuclear
Nuclear Easy and Cheap 
Every research is being leaked so I decided that this project should be open source.

Why the Ukraine war is good for the Russian Lithium Source.


## Simple Source of Tritium
- Lithium recycling as a source of lithium
- Lithium bombardment with neutrons
- Lithium turns into Tritium seen in the Castle Bravo bombs.

## Retrofitting Nuclear Reactors
- Pump Lithium/Cobalt into the reactor
- Lithium turns into helium and tritium
- Cobalt turns into cobalt 60

## Cost of Tritium
- $30000 estimated price per gram
- $1/kg Cost of Lithium Scrap
- Cheap and easy with a neutron source such as nuclear reactors

## Replenishing the Expiring Tritium in the Nuclear Warheads
- Nuclear warheads with Tritium needs to be replaced after few half lives of Tritium.

## Remote Nuclear Detonator
- a Farnsworth fusor can be utilized to create a dense neutron source
- a satellite containing a fusor can deactivate a warhead through rapid decay or remote detonate an icbm warhead.
- Nuclear countries with satellites can deactivate nuclear bombs.
- Nuclear bombs with the ability to disable nuclear bombs makes launching nuclear bombs easier.


## Further usages of excess Tritium
- Lightweight clean Tritium warheads on lightweight drones

## Plutonium refining from U238
- U235 is hard to obtain
- U238 is found in nature
- A fusor can be used to generate neutrons to create plutonium. Pu239 weapons grade specifically
- place U238 into a vessel with a fusor to create plutonium
- The plutonium can be used as the fission source
- Low Cost tritium is the fusion fuel
- Low Cost hydrogen bombs.
- No expensive centrifuge needed!
